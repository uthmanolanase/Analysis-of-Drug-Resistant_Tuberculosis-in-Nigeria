# Analysis of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Nigeria

This project presents an independent R-based analysis of the burden and trends of multidrug/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) in Nigeria from 2008 to 2023. Using publicly available WHO Global TB surveillance data, the analysis includes descriptive statistics, data visualization, correlation analysis, and linear regression to explore patterns and predictors of treatment initiation.

## Methods
- Descriptive statistics to examine temporal patterns
- Line and scatter plots using `ggplot2` for visual representation
- Correlation analysis to assess relationships between case estimates and treatment data
- Linear regression to identify potential predictors of treatment coverage

## Tools & Packages
- R Markdown (for reproducible reporting)
- ggplot2, dplyr, readr (for data wrangling and visualization)
- flextable, officer (for automated reporting)
